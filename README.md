# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab Reports & CTF Write-ups  

Welcome to my collection of **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) reports** and **CTF walkthroughs**.  
This repository is where I document my learning journey in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity challenges.  

Each report includes:
- **Reconnaissance steps** (how I scanned and identified services)
- **Exploitation process** (how I gained access)
- **Proof of Concept (PoC)**
- **Privilege escalation techniques**
- **Mitigation recommendations**
- **Lessons learned & skills practiced**
