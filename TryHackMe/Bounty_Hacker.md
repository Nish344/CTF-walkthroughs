Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) Report
Bounty Hacker (TryHackMe)
Prepared by: Nishanth AntonyDate: August 08, 2025Difficulty: EasyPlatform: TryHackMeCategory: Privilege Escalation / Web Exploitation  

üìã Executive Summary
This report details my penetration test of the Bounty Hacker machine on TryHackMe (IP: 10.201.27.76). I identified security weaknesses, gained user access, and escalated to root to capture two flags (secret codes). The main issues were:  

An open FTP server allowing anonymous access.  
Exposed files with a username and password list.  
Weak SSH credentials.  
A misconfigured command allowing full system control.

This beginner-friendly report explains the process simply, highlights vulnerabilities, and suggests fixes to secure the system.  

üéØ Scope
I tested the Bounty Hacker machine to find security flaws, gain access, and capture the user and root flags. This simulated a real-world hack to learn how to find and fix vulnerabilities.  

üö® Key Vulnerabilities



Vulnerability
Impact
Fix



Anonymous FTP Access
Exposed sensitive files to anyone
Disable anonymous FTP or restrict access


Exposed Password Files
Revealed username and passwords for attacks
Secure files with permissions or encryption


Weak SSH Credentials
Allowed unauthorized login as user lin
Use strong passwords and enable MFA


Misconfigured Sudo (tar)
Enabled full system control (root access)
Restrict sudo to safe, specific commands



üõ†Ô∏è Exploitation Steps
1. Scanning the System (Reconnaissance)

[08:30] Scanned for open services using nmap.  
Command:  nmap -sV 10.201.27.76


Findings:  
Port 21: FTP (vsftpd 3.0.3, file sharing).  
Port 22: SSH (OpenSSH 7.2p2, remote login).  
Port 80: Web server (Apache 2.4.18).  
Port 990: Closed (FTPS).


Why It Matters: Identified entry points (FTP, SSH) to focus my attack.



2. Exploring FTP (File Access)

[08:35] Connected to FTP using ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù (no password).  
Command:  ftp 10.201.27.76


Actions: Listed files with ls -la. Found:  
task.txt: Contained username lin.  
locks.txt: List of passwords.


How I Read Them: Used less task.txt and less locks.txt after cat failed.  
Why It Matters: These files gave me a username and passwords to try for SSH.



3. Breaking into SSH (User Access)

[08:45] Used hydra to test passwords from locks.txt for user lin.  
Command:  hydra -l lin -P /home/Nishanth/locks.txt 10.201.27.76 ssh


Findings: Found the correct password for lin.  
Next Steps: Logged in via SSH and found user.txt with the user flag.  
Commands:  ssh lin@10.201.27.76
cat user.txt




Why It Matters: Gained user access and captured the first flag.



4. Becoming Root (Privilege Escalation)

[09:00] Checked commands lin could run as a superuser.  
Command:  sudo -l


Findings: lin could run tar as root.


[09:05] Used a tar trick to get a root shell.  
Command:  sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh


Result: Got a root shell (full system control).


[09:10] Found the root flag in root.txt.  
Command:  cat /root/root.txt


Why It Matters: Captured the root flag and took over the system.




üß† Lessons Learned

Lock FTP: Prevent anonymous access and limit file visibility.  
Hide Secrets: Don‚Äôt leave usernames or passwords in open files. Use permissions or encryption.  
Secure SSH: Use strong passwords and add multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
Fix Sudo: Limit what commands users can run as root. Check with sudo -l.  
Scan Regularly: Use nmap to find and fix open services before attackers do.


üíª Skills Demonstrated

Service Enumeration: Identified open ports and services with nmap and ftp.  
Password Brute-Forcing: Cracked SSH credentials using hydra.  
SSH Exploitation: Gained user access with cracked credentials.  
Privilege Escalation: Exploited a misconfigured tar command to gain root access.


üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Files Used

Tools:  
nmap: Scanned for open services.  
ftp: Accessed file server.  
hydra: Brute-forced SSH passwords.  
ssh: Logged into the system.  
sudo: Checked and exploited permissions.  
tar: Used for privilege escalation.


Files:  
task.txt, locks.txt, user.txt, root.txt, /home/Nishanth/locks.txt


Environment: TryHackMe (Ubuntu Linux), Kali Linux


üåü Final Thoughts
By exploiting these vulnerabilities, I demonstrated how an attacker could take full control of a system, from accessing files to gaining root privileges. These issues‚Äîopen FTP, exposed passwords, weak logins, and risky sudo settings‚Äîare common in real-world systems. Fixing them is critical to protect servers from hackers. This exercise sharpened my skills in finding and securing vulnerabilities, preparing me to better protect real-world systems.
